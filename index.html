    <p>This website is about akan people,The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living in the southern regions of present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast in West africa. 
    <br> The Akan language is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family.<br>
    this project is about the names of their children representing the days of the week. 
    Akan people are believed to have migrated to their current location from the Sahara desert and Sahel regions of Africa<br>
     into the forest region around the 11th century. Many Akans tell their history as it started in the eastern region of Africa as this is<br>
      where the ethnogenesis of the Akan as we know them today happened. </p>
